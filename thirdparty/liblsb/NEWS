What's new in liblsb

2016-03-10:
  - Bugfix: submicroseconds measurements enabled
  - Bugfix: fixed struct initializiation making craycc complaining

TODO:
  - Calling LSB_Flush() before the LSB_Finalize() can result in an incorrect behavior. 
    The flushing should preserve the last parameters set by the user via (LSB_Set_Rparam_int/string).
  - Mac: multithread & PAPI doesn't work

Feature requests:
  - Add support for multiple (i.e., >2) PAPI counters 
  - Temporal window synchronization
  - Support to check if a measurent is within a certain CI at runtime.
  - Mac: LSB_Set_Rparam_int should take a int64_t insteand of an int32_t
