abstract = {Many problems consist of a structured grid of points that are updated repeatedly based on the values of a fixed set of neighboring points in the same grid. To parallelize these problems we can geometrically divide the grid into chunks that are processed by different processors. One challenge with this approach is that the update of points at the periphery of a chunk requires values from neighboring chunks. These are often located in remote memory belonging to different processes. The naive implementation results in a lot of time spent on communication leaving less time for useful computation. By using the Ghost Cell Pattern communication overhead can be reduced. This results in faster time to completion.},

abstract = {Python has become the de facto language for scientific computing. Programming in Python is highly productive, mainly due to its rich science-oriented software ecosystem built around the NumPy module. As a result, the demand for Python support in High Performance Computing (HPC) has skyrocketed. However, the Python language itself does not necessarily offer high performance. In this work, we present a workflow that retains Python's high productivity while achieving portable performance across different architectures. The workflow's key features are HPC-oriented language extensions and a set of automatic optimizations powered by a data-centric intermediate representation. We show performance results and scaling across CPU, GPU, FPGA, and the Piz Daint supercomputer (up to 23,328 cores), with 2.47x and 3.75x speedups over previous-best solutions, first-ever Xilinx and Intel FPGA results of annotated Python, and up to 93.16% scaling efficiency on 512 nodes.},
