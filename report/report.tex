%The hard page limit is 6 pages in this style. Do not reduce font size
%or use other tricks to squeeze. This pdf is formatted in the American letter format, so the spacing may look a bit strange when printed out.

\begin{abstract}
%Describe in concise words what you do, why you do it (not necessarily
%in this order), and the main result.  The abstract has to be
%self-contained and readable for a person in the general area. You
%should write the abstract last.
%\the\columnwidth (divide by 72.27 to get in inches = 3.287in)
%\the\textheight (divide by 72.27 to get in inches = 8.897in)
We present here implementation concepts optimized for parallelism for selected polybench algorithms: doitgen, jacobi1d and jacobi2d.
We explore both a thread-level parallelization using OpenMP and process-level parallelization using MPI to determine the main optimization axis for those problems.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\input{introduction}

%Do not start the introduction with the abstract or a slightly modified
%version. It follows a possible structure of the introduction. 
%Note that the structure can be modified, but the
%content should be the same. Introduction and abstract should fill at most the first page, better less.

%\mypar{Motivation} The first task is to motivate what you do.  You can
%start general and zoom in one the specific problem you consider.  In
%the process you should have explained to the reader: what you are doing,
%why you are doing, why it is important (order is usually reversed).

%For example, if my result is the fastest sorting implementation ever, one
%could roughly go as follows. First explain why sorting is important
%(used everywhere with a few examples) and why performance matters (large datasets,
%realtime). Then explain that fast implementations are very hard and
%expensive to get (memory hierarchy, vector, parallel). 

%Now you state what you do in this paper. In our example: 
%presenting a sorting implementation that is
%faster for some sizes as all the other ones.

%\mypar{Related work} Next, you have to give a brief overview of
%related work. For a report like this, anywhere between 2 and 8
%references. Briefly explain what they do. In the end contrast to what
%you do to make now precisely clear what your contribution is.

\section{Background: Selected Algorithms}\label{sec:background}
\input{background}

%Give a short, self-contained summary of necessary
%background information. For example, assume you present an
%implementation of sorting algorithms. You could organize into sorting
%definition, algorithms considered, and asymptotic runtime statements. The goal of the
%background section is to make the paper self-contained for an audience
%as large as possible. As in every section
%you start with a very brief overview of the section. Here it could be as follows: In this section 
%we formally define the sorting problem we consider and introduce the algorithms we use
%including a cost analysis.

%\mypar{Sorting}
%Precisely define sorting problem you consider.

%\mypar{Sorting algorithms}
%Explain the algorithm you use including their costs.

%As an aside, don't talk about "the complexity of the algorithm.'' It's incorrect,
%problems have a complexity, not algorithms.


\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experimental_setup}
\input{experimental_setup}

\section{Doitgen}\label{sec:doitgen}

\subsection{OpenMP}\label{sec:doitgenOpenMp}

\input{doitgen_openmp}

\subsection{MPI}\label{sec:doitgenMPI}
\input{doitgen_mpi}

%Now comes the ``beef'' of the report, where you explain what you
%did. Again, organize it in paragraphs with titles. As in every section
%you start with a very brief overview of the section.

%In this section, structure is very important so one can follow the technical content.

%Mention and cite any external resources that you used including libraries or other code.

\section{Jacobi}

\subsection{OpenMP}
\input{jacobi_omp}

\subsection{MPI}
\input{jacobi_mpi}

%\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec:jacobi_mpi_exp}

%Here you evaluate your work using experiments. You start again with a
%very short summary of the section. The typical structure follows.

%\mypar{Experimental setup} 
%Specify the platform (processor, frequency, maybe OS, maybe cache sizes)
%as well as the compiler, version, and flags used. If your work is about performance, 
%I strongly recommend that you play with optimization flags and consider also icc for additional potential speedup.

%Then explain what kind of benchmarks you ran. The idea is to give enough information so the experiments are reproducible by somebody else on his or her code.
%For sorting you would talk about the input sizes. For a tool that performs NUMA optimization, you would specify the programs you ran.

%\mypar{Results}
%Next divide the experiments into classes, one paragraph for each. In each class of experiments you typically pursue one questions that then is answered by a suitable plot or plots. For example, first you may want to investigate the performance behavior with changing input size, then how your code compares to external benchmarks.

%For some tips on benchmarking including how to create a decent viewgraph see pages 22--27 in \cite{Pueschel:10}.

%{\bf Comments:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Create very readable, attractive plots (do 1 column, not 2 column plots
%for this report) with readable font size. However, the font size should also not be too large; typically it is smaller than the text font size.
%An example is in Fig.~\ref{fftperf} (of course you can have a different style).
%\item Every plot answers a question. You state this question and extract the
%answer from the plot in its discussion.
%\item Every plot should be referenced and discussed.
%\end{itemize}

%\begin{figure}\centering
  %\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{dft-performance.eps}
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{test.pdf}
%  \caption{Performance of four single precision implementations of the
%  discrete Fourier transform. The operations count is roughly the
%  same. The labels in this plot are maybe a little bit too small.\label{fftperf}}
%\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}
\input{conclusion}

%Here you need to summarize what you did and why this is
%important. {\em Do not take the abstract} and put it in the past
%tense. Remember, now the reader has (hopefully) read the report, so it
%is a very different situation from the abstract. Try to highlight
%important results and say the things you really want to get across
%such as high-level statements (e.g., we believe that .... is the right
%approach to .... Even though we only considered x, the
%.... technique should be applicable ....) You can also formulate next
%steps if you want. Be brief. After the conclusions there are only the references.

%\section{Further comments}

%Here we provide some further tips.

%\mypar{Further general guidelines}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item For short papers, to save space, I use paragraph titles instead of
%subsections, as shown in the introduction.

%\item It is generally a good idea to break sections into such smaller
%units for readability and since it helps you to (visually) structure the story.

%\item The above section titles should be adapted to more precisely
%reflect what you do.

%\item Each section should be started with a very
%short summary of what the reader can expect in this section. Nothing
%more awkward as when the story starts and one does not know what the
%direction is or the goal.

%\item Make sure you define every acronym you use, no matter how
%convinced you are the reader knows it.

%\item Always spell-check before you submit (to us in this case).

%\item Be picky. When writing a paper you should always strive for very
%high quality. Many people may read it and the quality makes a big difference.
%In this class, the quality is part of the grade.

%\item Books helping you to write better: \cite{Higham:98} and \cite{Strunk:00}.

%\item Conversion to pdf (latex users only): 

%dvips -o conference.ps -t letter -Ppdf -G0 conference.dvi

%and then

%ps2pdf conference.ps
%\end{itemize}

%\mypar{Graphics} For plots that are not images {\em never} generate the bitmap formats
%jpeg, gif, bmp, tif. Use eps, which means encapsulate postscript. It is
%scalable since it is a vector graphic description of your graph. E.g.,
%from Matlab, you can export to eps.

%The format pdf is also fine for plots (you need pdflatex then), but only if the plot was never before in the format 
%jpeg, gif, bmp, tif.


% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: bibl_conf). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.
